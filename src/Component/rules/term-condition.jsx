        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">

          action.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
          3. Interest & Fees

        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">

          to credit agencies.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
          6. Amendments
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          The lender may update these terms at any time. Continued use of loan
          services indicates acceptance of updated terms.
